Create a client\nvar auth = googleAuth();\n\nauth.authorizeRequest({\n  method: 'get',\n  uri: 'https://www.googleapis.com/something'\n}, function (err, authorizedReqOpts) {\n/*\n  authorizedReqOpts =

token.\n```js\nauth.getToken(function (err, token) {\n/*\n  token = 'access token'\n*/\n});\n```\n\n<a name=\"automatic-if\"></a>\nThis works automatically **if**:\n\n  - your app runs on Google Cloud Platform\n  - you are authenticated with the `gcloud` sdk\n  - you have the path to a JSON key file as an environment variable named `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`\n\nIf you do not meet those, you must provide a `keyFilename` or `credentials` object.\n\n```js\nvar googleAuth = require('google-auto-auth');\n\nvar authConfig = {};\n\n// path to a key:\nauthConfig.keyFilename = '/path/to/keyfile.json';\n\n// or a credentials object:\nauthConfig.credentials = {\n  client_email: '...',\n  private_key: '...'\n};\n\n// Create a client\nvar auth =

require('google-auto-auth')\n\n#### auth = googleAuth([authConfig])\n\n##### authConfig\n\n- Type: `Object`\n\nSee the above section on Authentication. This object is necessary if automatic authentication is not available in your environment.\n\nAt a glance, the supported properties for this method are:\n\n- `credentials` - Object containing `client_email` and `private_key` properties\n- `keyFilename` - Path to a .json, .pem, or .p12 key file\n- `projectId` - Your project ID\n- `scopes` - Required scopes for the desired API request\n- `token` - An access token. If provided, we'll use this instead of fetching a new one\n\n#### auth.authorizeRequest(reqOpts, callback)\n\nExtend an HTTP request object with an authorized header.\n\n##### callback(err, authorizedReqOpts)\n\n###### callback.err\n\n- Type: `Error`\n\nAn API error or an error if scopes are required for the request you're trying to make (check for err.code = `MISSING_SCOPE`). If you receive the missing scope error, provide the `authConfig.scopes` array with the necessary scope URLs for your request. There are examples of scopes that are required for some of the Google Cloud Platform services in the [gcloud-node Authentication Guide](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/gcloud-node/#/authentication).\n\n###### callback.authorizedReqOpts\n\n- Type: `Object`\n\nThe reqOpts object provided has been extended with a valid access token attached to the `headers.Authorization` value. E.g.: `headers.Authorization = 'Bearer y.2343...'`.\n\n#### auth.getAuthClient(callback)\n\nGet the auth client instance from [google-auth-library](http://gitnpm.com/googleauth).\n\n##### callback(err, authClient)\n\n###### callback.err\n\n- Type: `Error`\n\nAn error that occurred while trying to get an authorization client.\n\n###### callback.authClient\n\n- Type: [`google-auth-library`](http://gitnpm.com/googleauth)\n\nThe client instance from [google-auth-library](http://gitnpm.com/googleauth). This is the underlying object this library uses.\n\n\n#### auth.getCredentials(callback)\n\nGet the `client_email` and `private_key` properties from an authorized client.\n\n##### callback(err, credentials)\n\n###### callback.err\n\n- Type: `Error`\n\nAn error that occurred while trying to get an authorization client.\n\n###### callback.credentials\n\n- Type: `Object`\n\nAn object containing `client_email` and `private_key`.\n\n\n#### auth.getEnvironment(callback)\n\nDetermine if the environment the app is running in is a Google Compute Engine instance.\n\n##### callback(err, environmentObject)\n\n###### callback.err\n\n- Type: `Null`\n\nWe won't return an error, but it's here for convention-sake.\n\n###### callback.environmentObject\n\n- Type: `Object`\n\n```js\n{\n  IS_APP_ENGINE: Boolean,\n  IS_CLOUD_FUNCTION: Boolean,\n  IS_COMPUTE_ENGINE: Boolean,\n  IS_CONTAINER_ENGINE: Boolean\n}\n```\n\nIf you've already run this function, the object will persist as `auth.environment`.\n\n\n#### auth.getProjectId(callback)\n\nGet the project ID if it was auto-detected or parsed from the provided keyfile.\n\n##### callback(err, projectId)\n\n###### callback.err\n\n- Type: `Error`\n\nAn error that occurred while trying to get an authorization client.\n\n###### callback.projectId\n\n- Type: `string`\n\nThe project ID that was parsed from the provided key file or auto-detected from the environment.\n\n\n#### auth.getToken(callback)\n\nGet an access token. The token will always be current. If necessary, background refreshes are handled automatically.\n\n##### callback(err, token)\n\n###### callback.err\n\n- Type: `Error`\n\nAn API error or an error if scopes are required for the request you're trying to make (check for err.code = `MISSING_SCOPE`). If you receive the missing scope error, provide the `authConfig.scopes` array with the necessary scope URLs for your request.\n\n###### callback.token\n\n- Type: `String`\n\nA current access token to be used during an API request.
